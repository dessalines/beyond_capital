The basis to understanding any anti-capitalist politics is the critique of capitalism found in Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels’ writings; their critique is one of the most systematic condemnations of capitalism to ever exist. Therefore, in order to properly understand why those on the left oppose and call for the abolishment of capitalism one needs to familiarize themselves with the core argument developed by Marx and Engels. The following section will examine the underlying aspects of the Marxian critique of capitalism: capital, labor-power, surplus value, and wage slavery.

# Capital

Capitalism is a politico-economic system characterized by the existence of private property, markets, entrepreneurship, work ethic, and individual volition. These characteristics are what are typically imagined when one thinks of capitalism. But when examined closer a much different picture is painted, a picture that looks nothing like the often celebrated capitalism we are familiar with. It is to this task that we turn our attention.

To start, we need to look at the root of the word capitalism -- capital. Capital consists of raw materials, instruments of labor and means of subsistence; [^1] the capitalist class therefore owns the necessary materials in order to produce use-values. But more importantly it also consists of commodities, products that are exchangeable for others, and exchange values, the particular ratio in which these commodities are exchanged, when expressed in money, their price. [^1].  However, not every sum of commodities and exchanges values are capital; they only become capital when they are exchanged for a commodity that adds *new value* when purchased, this commodity is labor-power. 

# Labor-Power

According to Marx, labor-power is the “aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in a human being, which he exercises whenever he produces a use-value of any description. ” [^2] Or to put it more succinctly labor-power is used to create use-values, an object that meets human needs i.e. cotton, iron, automotives, machines, etc. The labor-power is bought like any other item on the market e.g. linen, sugar, clothing, etc.The capitalist can purchase two pounds of sugar for five dollars or buy twelve hours of labor-power for five dollars; this exchange of money for labour-power shows what lies behind the transaction between worker and capitalist that appears in the form of wages. 

Labor-power for Marx is the “worker’s own life-activity, the manifestation of his own life.” [^3]. Because the “free laborer” is forced to sell their own labor-power, this life-activity becomes alien to the worker, it is reduced to only a means for survival. Instead of laboring to create an object that belongs to the worker, an object that is a manifestation of the workers unique creative faculties or interests, this power now belongs to the capitalist. What the worker creates through their labor: computers, buildings, automotives is instead transmogrified into food, clothing, rent. Instead of labor being a testament to the workers creative passions, laboring means to sacrifice hours of one’s life. Life for the worker begins only when they cease laboring and return to their house, bed or a place of leisure. 

# Surplus Value

Now we turn to the question of why the capitalist buys labor-power in the first place. It was mentioned above that in order to add *new value* to a commodity the labor-power of the worker must be purchased. But what is unique to the commodity labor-power that it is able to add new value, does it possess a magical quality that we do not know of? The capitalist has two goals in mind when purchasing this labor-power. First, to produce a use-value that has an exchange value, a commodity that is destined to be sold. Secondly, the capitalist wants to produce a commodity whose value is greater than the sum of the values the commodity used in its production.
 
When the capitalist purchases labor-power,  the worker is given a wage that is less than the full value that the laborer produces in the time worked for the capitalist. This wage is often the minimum amount needed to maintain the worker allowing him/her to return the next day. The value that the worker creates above the amount paid in the wage is understood as the surplus value or profit. This is the magical quality of labor-power that the capitalist is after. In order to understand where this surplus value comes from we must look at the composition of the average working day for the laborer. 

Using arbitrary values, let us suppose that the amount of daily materials needed for the workers continued existence amounts to four hours of labor-power. If the worker labors for only four hours and then goes home, no surplus-value is created. But the capitalist purchased the laboring-power for an entire working day, which we will assume to be nine hours. After working the four hours necessary to create enough value for the capitalist to recuperate the cost paid in wages the worker continues to work for the remaining five hours. During this period the worker is creating surplus value, value that belongs to the capitalist. This period of five hours is unpaid labor, the worker is essentially working for free. 

Ultimately the capitalist is after the accumulation of an ever increasing amount of surplus values i.e. profit. The capitalist can introduce new technology that allows the worker to produce more in the period of unpaid labor but this advantage is eventually negated by other capitalists adopting the same technology. Therefore the capitalist can accumulate more surplus value by increasing absolute surplus value by lengthening the working day, intensifying the work done, and limiting breaks or by increasing relative surplus value which is done by cutting the wages of the worker, which requires a decrease in the value of the means of subsistence for the worker to return to work. Due to the limit of a twenty-four hour day, increasing relative surplus value provides more opportunity than absolute surplus value. 


# Wage-Slavery

In order for the capitalist to continue purchasing labor-power a class that possesses nothing but its capacity to labor is a necessary prerequisite of capital; this class is known as the proletariat or the working-class [^1]. Because the worker has no possession other than their labor-power and the capitalist class owns the means of production, they cannot quit the “whole class of purchasers, that is, the capitalist class,” without renouncing their own life. This is what is termed wage-slavery, the inability to quit the capitalist class without renouncing their own life, and provides the explanation to why the worker would continue to labor for less than the full value of their labor. Moreover it is left to the worker to find a purchaser within this capitalist class. The worker sells their labor-power to the highest bidder, a capitalist, in order to purchase the necessary means of subsistence for their continued survival. 

# Conclusion

While it may seem that the capitalism of today functions in a drastically different fashion than it did a century ago, the underlying relationship in which the workers labor in the world has remained the same. Even though most workers in the developed nations are now employed in the service sector, especially so in the United States, the teachers, doctors, truck drivers, and secretaries are still compulsed to sell hours of their life on the market in order to receive the necessary materials to prolong their existence.  This process continues to survive because it is fundamental to the existence of capitalism. As long as capitalism continues, the worker is still forced to find a buyer in order sell hours of their life and must continue doing so in order to sustain their existence. The creative capacity of the individual (labor) is reduced to a means to continue their existence.
