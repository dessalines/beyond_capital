#### What Socialists Believe

[Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) is an economic and social system defined by **social ownership of the means of production**. (Workers democratically own and operate the places in which they work, as opposed to private control of production aka [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism))

The [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production) are non-human inputs that create economic value, such as **factories, workplaces, industrial machinery**, etc. The means of production are the means of life. Socialists refer to the means of production as capital, or private property. Private property in the socialist context shouldn't be confused with [personal property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property#Personal_versus_private_property), such as your home, car, computer, and other possessions.

In a capitalist society the means of production are owned and controlled privately, by those that can afford them (the capitalist aka those with capital). Production is carried out to **benefit the capitalist** (production for profit). Workers are paid a wage, and **receive that amount regardless of how much value they produce**. Socialists call this difference the [surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_value), IE (value produced - wage paid). A 1983 report by England national income and expenditures found that on average, 26 minutes of every hour worked(or 43% of labor value added) by english workers across a wide range of industries went to various exploiting or unproductive groups, with workers receiving only 57% of their pre-tax productive output as wages. 

Capitalists use the surplus to [push out competitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices) and gain market share, leading to the destruction of most small businesses, with [a few companies](http://imgur.com/a/xgnEp) controlling our food, media, energy, transportation, and finances.

[Wage workers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oztdRo9GLLk) are **completely dependent** on selling their labor power to those in control of production in order to gain access to the necessities of life (money for food, shelter, clothing, etc). Its similarities to chattel slavery has lead many to term wage work as [wage slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery), with voluntary employment being simply a false choice between **one exploiter or another**. 

Many Marxists call the totalitarian regimes typically called socialist, as more correctly defined as [State Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism), since production was controlled by state bureaucracies who also distributed the surplus, rather than through the democratic input of workers. However, the early stages of the [1917 russian revolution](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution) were far more progressive than is typically portrayed; Divorce was legalized, **Homosexuality was decriminalized**, land was distributed to the peasantry, banks were nationalized, control of factories was given to worker's councils, **the workday was shortened**, wages were fixed at a higher rate, all elected officials could now be immediately recalled, it created mass literacy drives, free nurseries, communal kitchens, and laundries. Western nations(including the US) [sent troops to russia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_intervention_in_the_Russian_Civil_War) to fight against the gains of the revolution. Most of these revolutionary gains were lost due to a multitude of factors(civil war, a drastic decrease of the numbers of working class (50% decrease in the industrial centers), decimation of russian industry) that merit deeper study. 

#### Capitalist Past, Socialist Future

Capitalism evolved historically out of [feudalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism), which itself evolved out of [slave societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery), all three being dependent on a dominant class receiving the surplus of a subordinate class. 

Communism is the highest developed stage of socialism wherein there is no state, no money, no class system. The means of production are owned by all and provide for everyone's needs. There are also presumably high levels of automation so [most do not have to work](http://imgur.com/yQpzb).

Socialism **can't exist within a capitalist system**, much like capitalism can't exist within a socialist system. There is either private ownership of the means of production or there isn't. Many socialists point to [directly democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy) [worker’s councils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workers'_council) as an ideal way to organize production.

Past and present socialist/anarchist societies include - [Revolutionary Catalonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia), [Anarchist Aragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_Aragon), Shinmin Province in Korea/Manchuria, [Free Territory of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Territory), The [Bavarian Soviet Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Soviet_Republic), The [Paris Commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_commune), The Zapatista controlled areas of Chiapas (current day), [Magonista Baja California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magonista_rebellion_of_1911), [Shanghai People's Commune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_People%27s_Commune), [Rojava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rojava) (current day), [Communist Marinaleda](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/marinaleda-spanish-communist-village-utopia), [USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) (highly debated) 

Private ownership of the means of production was established through force and [private tyranny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVt7U2YIgZs), and is only upheld through force. **The state is an instrument of class domination** which (in capitalist society) exercises a monopoly on violence to forcibly maintain the right to private property. The modern state developed alongside the emergent capitalist system as the bourgeoisie seized political and economic control. It arises from the irreconcilable class antagonisms that exist in society.

Socialism as an economic system is distinct from [neoliberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism), as well as [social democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy)/Welfare [state capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism), which aims to band-aid the ills of capitalism while leaving the exploitation inherent in [wage slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery) intact. 

[Revolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_socialism) vs [Evolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformism) socialism, [Economic planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy) with [labor vouchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_voucher) vs. [Market socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism), are a few debated topics within socialism.
